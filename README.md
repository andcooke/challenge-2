# Portfolio

Website can be accessed at: https://andcooke.github.io/challenge-2/

## Description

This is my proto-page made to attempt a future pixel-perfect recreation of a future portfolio page.

## Usage

! ["screenshot of my page"](./assets/images/portfolio-screenshot.jpeg)

This page is meant to be a portfolio. In it's current state you can click the "Contact Landing Me" page link in the porfolio and it will open up that page in a new tab. 

The other projects are not yet added to this page.

The fixed header is there to take you to different sections within the document. And the image on the left side is meant to return you to the top when viewed on a large screen. 



## Credits

A lot of this code is thanks to Meg Meyers. Without her this most certainly would not be possible.
